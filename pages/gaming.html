            <b>GAME PREFERENCES</b>
            <P> I mostly play RPG's (role-playing games) or FPS (first-person shooter) games, and
                Tripple A horror games. That is for PC and video game console such PS5 or nintendo switch. 
                And like most other gamers, I sometimes play and stream my games in Twitch.tv. 
                The last time I was able to stream and play my ps5 was about a year ago and streamed 
                the game Elden Ring. 
            </P>
            <p> Some of my favorite title in PS and PC are Tales series, Outlast, Assassin's Creed, 
                God of War, Resident Evil, Dying Light and Last of US (part 1 and 2 is a must). There is much more
                game in the list but it is just too much to mention even half of it.

                Currently playing Ragnarok Origin Mobile. Which surprised me first, how good is the 
                game graphics and mechanics just because it is native to mobile gaming. Great game
                indeed and highly recommend it because of the portability.
            </p>
            <p> In regards to table-top gaming, I exclusively play Magic: The Gathering card games. It is
                in my opinion, the best card game ever invented. The amount of combinations of spells
                and creatures and mechanics in this card game is unsurpassed by any other game. It is an
                evolving game and the constant updates and upgrades is one of the unique feature of the
                game. Nothing even come close to this kind of table top gaming. I have been playing this
                game for more than 15 years now. And still going.
            </p>
            <p> These days I have less and less time to play games. But they say that once a gamer will
                always be a gamer.
            </p>
            <p>Game on!</p>
